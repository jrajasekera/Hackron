# Hackron: Super Sombrero

## What is it?
My team and I created the Super Sombrero to assist blind people in navigating their environments.

The Super Sombrero is a hat equipped with ultrasonic sensors and a Raspberry Pi. 
The scripts in this project monitor the distances detected by the sensors and alerts the user when they are getting close to an object.
